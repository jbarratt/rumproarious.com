[Why I Don’t Use Flipboard, but My Dad Does — The Brooks
Review](http://brooksreview.net/2010/12/flipboard-2/) — Matthew Ingram on
GigaOm had this to say about Flipboard: But I wonder whether the
flip-style interface for the app isn't inherently contradictory to using
it as a business or work tool - since it seems more like browsing as you

consumption or information-intake tool?

[Malcolm Gladwell Is #Wrong:
Change Observer: Design
Observer](http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=19008) —

opinion based on little more than a bystander’s observations.

[Curveship: Interactive Fiction + Interactive
Narrating](http://curveship.com/) — Curveship is an interactive fiction
system that provides a world model (of characters, objects, locations,
and things that happen) while also modeling the narrative discourse, so

The largest underground "movement" in the Drupal community is the desire
for a shift in goals, which has been labeled Smallcore. This movement
has been rapidly growing among Drupal developers, who instinctively
understand the need for and advantages of such an approach, but up until
to now there has not been any concrete and constructive communication to
the rest of the world about why we feel this approach has merit.

I recently submitted a [talk](http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/517)
to [open source bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/). It’s a new
conference dedicated to the ideas behind open source.

My talk is about how I patch over the holes that are created between
systems like [google reader](http://google.com/reader),
[tumblr](http://tumblr.com), and [twitter](http://twitter.com). All of
that work has been eclipsed by a new tool called
[ifttt](http://ifttt.com/). They don’t win any points in the name
pronunciation department, but there tool works. The idea is if this,
then that.

Like if you tweet a link, then post it to tumblr.

I saw someone playing around with it on [picplz](http://picplz.com) the
other day so I signed up.

I have been building my own tools for years to glue things like google
reader, which I love using, to tools like twitter, which I am not so
stoked about. They are still missing two things. I like to track my
links stats, it’s 10x easier if I can use my own bit.ly api token, it’s
even better if I can use my own shortener service, but all take just
using my own bit.ly API key. The second thing that is missing is rate
limiting things to twitter.

Twitter is a medium where people don’t like it when one user dominates
their stream. If you tweet like 5 things in a row, it doesn’t matter if
you tweeted awesome things, it looks like spam. Users will unsubscribe,
besides that you get more twitter juice if things trickle into the
twitter sphere.

So, [these guys](http://media.ifttt.com/blog/ifttt-team.jpg) are
building something quite cool. If they get everything I need I would be
willing to spend close to $100 a year for their service. $100 a year
because all of these things have required me to buy something like a
[linode](http://www.linode.com/) before, which even at it’s cheapest is
$239.40. So, I am saving 130 bucks, without the overhead of trying to
keep it running.

## Update:

They have already been hard at work adding the ability to share things
on google reader. Awesome.

HTML5 Apps have been on my mind lately. Terminology is coming into play.
I see two, or three big terms out there right now.

-   [HTML5
    Apps](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/03/html5_apps.html):
    found on Quirksmode
-   [Web Stack
    Apps](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/06/03/app-shopping/):
    found on Eric Meyer's site
-   WebApps: Not really anywhere, just found in conversations, mayby
    that is more important.

Not sure what is going to win, but its fun to document things like this.
Oh, and I vote for HTML5 Apps.

title: Using Your Web Skills To Write iPhone Apps
wordpress_id: '11'

A friend of mine is really trying hard to write and iphone app. He is
held back by nothing but knowledge of coding. I am sure with a grounding
in the great languages of the web he could do anything he wanted, web
apps, web pages, iPhone app, why not? Starting to learn how to code on
the web is a great way to start a programming education. By far I would
imagine more people use JS to code then any other language. I am sure
most of them don't even know they are coding when the use it. This has
lead to a lot of problems, but from a pure pedagogical standpoint its
quite amazing.

So why not take your webskillz to the iPhone. Past that, why not get
paid to take your webskillz to the iPhone. Get your app in the app
store, shake your money maker. So here are some links to get started

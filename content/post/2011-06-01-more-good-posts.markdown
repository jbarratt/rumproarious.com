[Talking with Eric Frank and Jon Williams about Flat World Knowledge, a commercial publisher of open textbooks « Jon Udell](http://blog.jonudell.net/2010/02/23/talking-with-eric-frank-and-jon-williams-about-flat-world-knowledge-a-commercial-publisher-of-open-textbooks/) —
My guests for this week's Innovators show are the co-founder (Eric
Frank) and CTO (Jon Williams) of Flat World Knowledge, a new textbook
publishing company with a refreshingly disruptive business model. Like
any other textbook publishing company, Flat World is building up a
stable of authors with whom it has exclusive (or, in this case,
semi-exclusive) relationships.

return - it's taking me a long while to catch up on everything that
built up while I was away.

I really want to know more about the publish2 platform, but you can't
really get in there unless you are a journalist. I think these guys are
creating a lot of awesome tools, but its like feeling someone's face in
the dark.

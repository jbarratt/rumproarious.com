It was 4 p.m. on a recent Friday-a time of the week when I usually relax
and leave the rest of my to-do list to finish over the weekend. But as
this recent weekend approached, I kept pushing myself, heart pumping, to
get to the bottom of my list of planned tasks for the week. *[The
ReportingOn Blog](http://reportingon.com/)* In 2008, I was awarded a
Knight News Challenge grant to build ReportingOn, a backchannel for beat
reporters to share ideas, information, and sources. The goal of the
project was to provide journalists of all stripes with a place to talk
about content, not craft, or process, or skillset. *[Slammer -
Designer's Geometry Box](http://ringce.com/slammer)* Slammer overlays
any grid you want, anywhere you want. Typographic Grids, Golden
Sections, Fibonacci series or Rule of Thirds. Slammer also has Rulers,
Crosshairs, Magnifier, Measurements & Screenshots. *[Mr. Penumbra’s

IT'S 2:02 A.M. ON A COLD SUMMER NIGHT. I'm sit­ting in a book store next
to a strip club.

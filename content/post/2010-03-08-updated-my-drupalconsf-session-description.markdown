### Intro

Social media is not always socializing on the web. It can also be about
the viral spread of information between people. For well over a decade
the internet has been providing a new means for communicating. For well
over a decade I have been slowly learning how to grok that flow of
information. Come to the sessions, and I will show you my methods for
filtering the stream to get the information you want. Specifically I
will talk about how to get information about Drupal, and how to pickup
on interesting discussions happening in the community.

### Topics of Discussion

-   Wrangling of RSS
-   Proficient use of a Blog Aggregator
-   Dealing with blogs, and information overload.
-   How to go from a consumer, to a producer

### A Specific Scenario Will Be Analyzed

In the last few months, I have been lucky enough to find some really
awesome Drupal gigs. One has given me a chance to work with [Jay
Rosen](http://pressthink.org), from NYU, on an [idea of
his](http://jayrosen.tumblr.com/post/281058818/this-is-a-mock-up-for-a-news-site-that-i-think)
to help news orgs find the best questions. I was also able to turn this
into a grant proposal that I entered into the Knight News Challenge. We
made it through the first round. Finally, it resulted in me becoming a
co-maintainer of the installation profile that
[ExplainThis.org](http://explainthis.org) is based on. All of these were
opportunities that I found through social media, or pursued through
social media.

### Supporting Materials

As the conferences gets closer, I will be posting supporting materials,
like slides, links to sites mentioned in my talk. I also really want to
engage the audience. I am planning on using twitter as a backchannel. If
you want to ask me a question anytime before, during, or after the
conference on twitter just use the hashtag,
[\#DCSF10AK](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#DCSF10AK).

### About the Presentor

Besides playing around with Drupal, I also dabble with Django, and other
open source projects. I currently work at Yahoo! as Front-end engineer.
At yahoo I do a lot of work with PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. And, as
you may have guessed, I am an avid consumer of the social web, as well
as curator/producer. I do my curate/production thing at my website

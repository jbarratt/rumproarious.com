There are lots of things in this world I don’t understand. Even more
that I think I know a little somethin about, but really don’t. These two
principals are what lead me to like the idea of having a president. I
like to vote for people, who will handle things like nuclear power for
me. I still need to figure out how to judge what a person will do in the
areas I don’t know, by looking at what they do, do in places that I do
no something about.

I like the current President, and the reason I think he is doing a good
job is based on the idea that he has policies about areas that I know a
lot about, or I actually know something about. First was his getting the
FCC to push hard on bandwidth, and then net neutrality. But the latest,
was his appointment of [Edward
Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003e0&topic_id=1)
to help track and explain the stimulus funds. He is really getting the
best people to come and help him do his job.

Okay, so it's not so much blog critique, but it's good critique of
writing. I asked about [blog
critique](http://alexkessinger.net/2011/06/05/blog-critique-where-is-it/%20)
a couple weeks ago. The question was prompted by [Alexis
Madrigal](http://www.niemanstoryboard.org/author/alexis-madrigal/ "View all posts by Alexis Madrigal"),
and guess what he has answered his own question. Here is his [critique
of a Truman
Capote](http://www.niemanstoryboard.org/2011/06/27/whys-this-so-good-no-1-truman-capote-new-yorker-alexis-madrigal/)
article. It's not a blog post, but this is what I am talking about. He
is looking at a technique used by a writer to engage the reader. I don't
know why this has been missing from my education, but these kinds of
breakdowns are how I learned how to program better. We need more of
these, maybe I should try my hand at one.

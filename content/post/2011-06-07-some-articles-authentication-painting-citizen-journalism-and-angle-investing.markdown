*[Who are you, really? The value of incorrect response in
challenge-response style authentication. « Hype
Cycles](http://hypecycles.wordpress.com/2009/09/27/who-are-you-really/)*
Service providers (electricity, cable, wireless phone, POTS telephone,
newspaper, banks, credit card companies) are regularly faced with the
challenge of identifying and validating the identity of the individual
who has called customer service. They have come up with elaborate

*[Dabblers and
Blowhards](http://idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm)*
About two years ago, the Lisp programmer and dot-com millionaire Paul
Graham wrote an essay entitled Hackers and Painters, in which he argues
that his approach to computer programming is better described by

*[A Simulation of Angel
Investing](http://jmillerinc.com/2010/04/27/angel-investing-simulation/)*
In angel investing, it's the extreme distribution of payoffs that keeps
things interesting. If anything, it resembles buying a deep
out-of-the-money call option, but with nonlinearity. If you win big you
might find yourself in on the ground floor of the next Google or
Facebook. That's incredibly unlikely, but still possible.

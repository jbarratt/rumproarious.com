When I stopped to sift through the many blogs I read I was struck by one common theme; I love blogs that let me peek into other professions at the elite level. Something about learning from other people who are performing at their peak is inspiring.

Another aspect of the feeds I read is that many aren't "written". Some of my favorite feeds just expose some of the best content in certain communities.

Basically, if I often stop to read a feed, the feed makes me laugh, or it just makes me exclaim WTF, I like it.


## Interesting Link Fountains

#### [Stellar Interesting's faves](http://stellar.io/interesting)
Kottke's side project stellar trys to aggregate stars/likes/hearts. The interesting feed surfaces the faves of all the things.

#### [Popular Favorites | MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/favorites/all)
Metafilter is a stalwart from the early web 2.0 days. It's built an awesome community. Unfortunately I don't take part in it, but I do use RSS to tap into the great discussions.

#### [Edward Tufte Forum](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a?topic_id=1)
this is a forum where people talk about visualization. It's slightly arcane. Sometimes they ask Edward Tufte questions; sometimes he answers. I subscribe to the feed because every once in a while the answer is amazing. Like this one on figuring out what theoretical theory to use when designing [analytical displays](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000KI&topic_id=1).

Zeldman has a huge effect on CSS, HTML, and Design. Through his blog, and his conferences.

#### [Jorge Quinteros](http://jorgeq.com/)

#### [ScriptShadow](http://scriptshadow.blogspot.com/)

#### [Brian S Hall](http://brianshall.com/)
There always has to be a guy in the room yelling at everyone else telling them how stupid they are. It keeps everyone honest.

#### [Global Guerrillas](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/)

#### [Khymos](http://blog.khymos.org/)
Dedicated to molecular gastronomy — New food tech: check.

#### [clusterflock](http://www.clusterflock.org/)
As far as I can tell clusterflock is a loose collective of people brought together through the Internet to tell stories of the Internet. Very hard to describe, but a fountain of win.

Admission: I worked at Yahoo. I did not work with Nicole, or Nicholas
but I am a fan their work. CSS Lint is an opinionated tool. It's meant
to be strict. Any lint, or style checker that isn't strict isn't doing
you a favor. The whole point of a style checker is to be strict. Now,
unlike other languages CSS doesn't have a central leadership. I think a
ton of CSS partitioners who might not know who Eric Meyer is, or have
never even used a CSS reset before. If you use a language like python,
you might have run across the
[PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). It's python's
officially adopted style guide. If you don't happen to program at all,
and only end up using CSS as a tool to design with you might have never
been exposed to such a style guide. If that is the case then CSS lint
could be a bit shocking. When I read [CSS Lint is
harmful](http://mattwilcox.net/archive/entry/id/1054/), the first thing
that popped into my head was I felt like this person may not be an
experienced programmer. When there is such vitriol levied against a
project like CSS Link I wonder if it might be a bunch of people who
aren't programmers. I would like to know if a lot of programmers out
there who really dislike CSS Lint. This is the biggest reason I felt the
author wasn't a programmer.

If you think that its okay to pass the buck on performance then the
author is completely right about CSS Lint. On the other hand, if you are
looking for ways to write performance oriented code, because you want
your pages to be faster, large company or not, then CSS Lint is a great
starting place. No one said it was the last word. For more discussion

I didn't get to go to [txjs](http://texasjavascript.com/), but I heard
it was awesome. It was organized by [Rebecca
Murphey](http://www.rebeccamurphey.com/). I just got around to seeing
her presentation on object literals to organise code. I found this great
little slide. If you have ever wrote large amount's of JS, you might
enjoy it as well. [![When does it make sense to use objects.

If you see this Ms. Murphey, with all do respect, don't use slide share.
Just hook us up with a PDF or something, so we can reference your work
without having to take screenshots.

Just after I finished installing mysql on my mac book pro, for the
umpteenth time. I realized quite possibly my favorite thing about Django
is the built in dev server, mixed with sqlite. This combination allows
you to go from idea, to mock in like 15 minutes. Drupal just doesn't
have that kind of speed when people just want to test some ideas out.

So, I have done some initial investigation, there is a [php
webserver](http://nanoweb.si.kz/) out there, but I haven't figured out
how I can just hook it in. Anyway here is my deck, Google doesn't allow me to embed my font, [chunk](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk), so its just whatever was stock.

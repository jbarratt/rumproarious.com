but I can't think of any awesome blog critique. I know things that I
love, and I can start to break them down, but I am nowhere near as good

love [longreads](http://longreads.com/), a curated stream of awesome
articles on the web, and want to get better at writing your self there
doesn't seem to be a watering hole for those people. So, not sure how to
rectify this, but I am going to start paying attention to some of the
tweeters that responded to the call.

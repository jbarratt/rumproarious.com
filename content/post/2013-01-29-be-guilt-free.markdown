Do not feel guilty for not reading the tidal wave of information that piles up on your door everyday. **Just don't**. Half the battle in this modern era of information overload is learning how to not care about all the information. We call them feeds, or streams for a reason â€” **they never end**. Your only goal should be to **build a better net**. It's not to worry about unread counts or friend requests, or virtual corn fields.

Take your net. Dip it into the stream. See what comes out.

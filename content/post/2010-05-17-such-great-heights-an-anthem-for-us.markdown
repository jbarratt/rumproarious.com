This morning I heard an [awesome
cover](http://www.rslblog.com/2010/05/ben-folds-music-interlude.html) of
the song by Ben Folds. That album is top of my all time top 5 list.

And it gets better, I just found a video of the cover.

The Postal Service, inspires a lot of people, and if you don't believe
me check out youtube, thousands of covers, over years.

From the not so good, kid in his room.

to the inventive.

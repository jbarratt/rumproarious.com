Today is an App.net Hack day and my project is an embeddable comments widget that is built on top App.net Posts. It's actually embedded on this page. So, feel free to test it out and give me feedback [@voidfiles](https://app.net/voidfiles). You will need an App.net account to see the comments (for now), and you will need one to leave a comment for sure.

If you are intrested in using this widget your self, just embed this code somewhere on a webpage. There is one bug right now, on mobile safari the browser is getting scrolled to the top of the comments, but other then that it should work.

**This is alpha** So the things like the url will change.

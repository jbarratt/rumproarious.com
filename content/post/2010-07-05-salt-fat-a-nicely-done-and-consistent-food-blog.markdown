Salt & Fat: a nicely done, and consistent food blog

One blog I have been really enjoying lately is [Salt &
Fat](http://saltandfat.com/). I can't say exactly why I enjoy there blog
more then the thousands of other cooking blogs, but I think it has
something to do with their consistency, and well doneness of their
content. ![Salt & Fat with mrgan & ray. Notes on Cooking & Enjoying
Food](http://confit.saltandfat.com/images/masthead.png "Salt & Fat Masthead")

Each post revolves around one idea. Usually a recipe, but it could also
be a kitchen instrument, or a news article that they have some
commentary on. The first article that really hit home with was one about
[burgers](http://saltandfat.com/post/657214062/burgers). Burgers have
been done to death, I think Rachel Ray said once that about a third of
her 30 minute meals are a burger of some kind, but Salt & Fat's
treatment of the subject was spot-on. It was a modern, if I may,
interpretation and explanation of backyard, and on the grill burgers.

So, if you were looking for a well-written insightful cooking blog take
a lot at [Salt & Fat](http://saltandfat.com/).

Ask, and ye shall recieve. Brent Simmons posted his OPML file on saturday[^brent_simmmons], and also wrote "I wish there were an OPML sharing service.". I am sure more than a handfull of people thought, I can do that, but [FeedShare](http://feedshare.net/inessential/) beat us all [^feedshare].

I added my [feeds](http://feedshare.net/voidfiles/) and I hope you do to.

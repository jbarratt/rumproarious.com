I wrote a piece for [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/) last week, they just
posted it today. It's called [Code
Pollution](http://dailyjs.com/2011/07/25/alex-kessinger/). I have always
loved finding new libs, it's just fun to find a new plugable app that
solves some problem you were having. Over time I learned that all
projects have warts, and nothing is magic, or plugable. There is still a
place in this world for good libs, but most of the time they are written
in a fury, and then left to die. I wrote code pollution because I wanted
to make an argument for why it's okay to use someone else's code. I
wanted to help someone get though the hard part and synthesize better
code through re-use.

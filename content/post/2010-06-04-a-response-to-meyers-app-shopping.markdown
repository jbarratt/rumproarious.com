I wrote this as a comment on a post over on Eric Meyers blog post [App
Shopping](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/06/03/app-shopping/)

I say lets build some things. I think your assessment of the [web
stack](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2010/05/19/the-web-stack/),
HTML5 Apps, is dead on, but I would argue that people are thinking about
web stacks, just not in a webby way, but an Obj-C way.

Checkout [Neven
Mrgan’s](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/661352675/countering-the-perception-that-the-iphone-os-is-too)
take on the fact that we need a good SDK for HTML5 Apps.

That is not the direction we should be headed. I think most web
developers are comfortable doing large portions of there development in
text editors. This is probably freaking out traditional app developers
who are used to their UI layout editors. They probably wonder why you
can’t just use Dreamweaver to export HTML5 Apps.

As far as frontend’s are concerned, I can’t seem to find many who
understand that they can write HTML5 Apps for the iPhone. Very few are
aware of the nice integration Apple has for HTML5 Apps. Even less know
about things like the [application
cache](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html).

If the web “pros” don’t know they can make nice, useful HTML5 Apps for
phones, then I think its an information problem.

Lastly, I think there is to much focus on the iPhone/iPad. We need to
bust out, and realize that a device with a HTML5 capable browser, is a
place where a HTML5 App can live.

I am thinking about Chrome OS, Google TV, so fourth, these platform will
more then likely have tight HTML5 integration.

Let’s keep making a ruckus, eventually we will beat enough web
developers over the head, before the Obj-C guys ruin the party. Oh, and
they are trying hard, check out the [280 North
guys](http://280north.com), with [cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org/),
[Objective-J](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-J), and
[Atlas](http://280atlas.com/), they are slowly building tools to make
native app developers happy, but we web developers don’t need all these
fancy tools. It all boils down the HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Hero's aren't talked about much. People are influences, we look up to
people, we think people are cool, but it's a bit gushy to call someone a
hero. I want to use the power of that term. The same feeling that makes
me uncomfortable about calling a person my hero, is the same part makes
it powerful.

I am writing more, and I am fueling my engine, which isn't easy with a
young family, and full-time job, but I don't want to make excuses
either, I just need to trick my self into writing more, so I give my
self assignments like this, and just like when you get a band together
it helps to talk about "influences," well I have heard that's something
you can do; when starting to writing a blog it might be helpful to talk
about ones hero's.

Yea, so I could try to give and exhaustive list of terms that describe
me here, and the explain why I think I have a diverse set of hero's, but
it was a bit pretentious, so instead I will just write the damn posts,
and you can decide if they are diverse.

A note to the side, while I frame hero's as people, mostly, There is a
broader definition that includes ideas, and movements. While often there
are people in these movements, and I like those people for their ideas
about a movement, I may not always agree with everything they have to
say, other than the piece that I find inspiring. People will have many
ideas in their life, and are defined by a few, but we may never truly
know another person, and I won't be held accountable for everything that
person has ever said.

It was nice knowing you were all out there, but now that [Google Reader is being killed](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html), I suppose, it's time to say goodbye.

Soon, over 99% of you will cease to subscribe to my feed. As you can see almost everyone who subscribes to my feed uses Google Reader.

If my feed looks at all like other feeds one day soon they are going to loose all their subscribers. In the grand scheme this is probably just a blip, but for many of us this... fuck I don't know its just a BFD.

I am going to rip this band aid off soon. I have been looking for a reason to migrate away from feedburner as well. Seeing as how I will loose all my subscribers anyway I'll just get this over with now.

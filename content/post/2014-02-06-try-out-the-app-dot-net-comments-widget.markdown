A week ago (maybe two), we had an App.net hackathon where I showed off an App.net based coments widget. Since then a couple of us have been working an official version of the widget. Its now in a state where I would like to start beta testing it. If you would like to test it out PM me on App.net ([@voidfiles](https://app.net/voidfiles)). I have also embedded the current version on this page.

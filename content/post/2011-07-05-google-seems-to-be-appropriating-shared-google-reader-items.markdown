I use google reader and I use have a google alert for my name. Most of
the time I learn a lot about a high school basketball player in
kentucky, ie not me, Today though I was alerted about a story I shared
in may, about [Childish
Gambino](https://plus.google.com/108319722006237870403/posts/GSGePFrcL4F),
but instead of it being a google reader share it was a google+ share. I
don't mind that my google reader stuff is on google plus, but I am sure
that some people might be concerned that that didn't purposefully choose
to share things like google reader on google+.

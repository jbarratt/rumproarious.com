Thingd?](http://erlebacher.org/2010/10/08/the-next-big-thingd/)*
Thingd (Thing Daemon) is building a structured database of every object
in the world and then mapping those objects (and associated metadata) to
people and to other objects. The concept is still in its early stages of
being realized, but it is a big ambitious idea and one worth thinking

Which approach do you take to managing information overload on the web?
Do you unleash the firehose on yourself, subscribing to RSS feeds or
relying on content aggregators to keep up with the news? Or do you take
small sips from the stream of content, regularly checking a small set of
websites to look for updates?

Last year I wrote a post about how having two kids in two years focused
my work. I still think this is true, and today I read a post by [Aaron
Mahnke](http://www.aaronmahnke.com/ "http://www.aaronmahnke.com/") about
almost the same topic.

[Wireframing My
Fiction](http://www.aaronmahnke.com/post/6507242825 "an article") is
about how Aaron focuses the small amount of time he has each day to
focus on personal projects. I feel like we both have the same idea with
slightly different frames.

I don't write fiction. I write blog posts, and make websites. My ideas
usually come to me in the weirdest places, so I write them down in
[simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com/) the best I can, and then I put
the idea like on the wall in my head. I will then continue to think
about it until I can't think about it anymore. Then it others spews into
a post, or into some code, and I'm done. Keeping the notes is key.
Without them I would forget some of the finer points of my thoughts.

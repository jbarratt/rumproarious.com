I have been hearing good things about the alternative google reader,
reader, [feedly](http://feedly.com). But I am just not seeing how its
more helpful then the original. They seem to be doing interesting things
with layout, and I guess they get credit for trying to dress up the
content by pulling in pictures.

Does anyone else find that it has any great features?

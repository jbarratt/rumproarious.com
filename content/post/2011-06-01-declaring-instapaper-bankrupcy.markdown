I have way to many articles sitting in my too blog folder of instapaper.
I am coping out and will just be posting large chunks of the list over
the next few days. This is almost a year's worth of reading. As I can
remember, I will try to say why I thought it was worth blogging about.

[Platforms as Tables, Tables as
Platforms](http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/380333137/platforms-as-tables-tables-as-platforms)
I am not entirely sure who [Frank Chimero](http://www.frankchimero.com/) is, or even what he does, but when ever this dude sits down to write something I will stop, and read it. He just always has something useful to say.

[CommonJS effort sets JavaScript on path for world
domination](http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/12/commonjs-effort-sets-javascript-on-path-for-world-domination.ars)
This has been a big year for JavaScript. New, fast engines have tested
their legs. Libraries have matured. With the ECMAScript 5 draft
proposal, the language is growing. However, the language remains largely
in exile, to only be used in Web browsers. This year has marked a
resurgence of efforts to make JavaScript useful outside the browser.

[Drupal or Django? A Guide for Decision Makers â€” scot hacker's foobar
blog](http://birdhouse.org/blog/2009/11/11/drupal-or-django/) - There's a
large body of technical information out there about content management
systems and frameworks, but not much written specifically for
decision-makers. Programmers will always have preferences, but it's the
product managers and supervisors of the world who often make the final
decision about what platform on which to deploy a sophisticated site.

[Inkling Prediction Market Solutions: News + Musings: 5
Whys](http://blog.inklingmarkets.com/2009/11/5-whys.html)
Didn't realize someone (Toyota) codified a technique like this. Inkling is a
huge fan of spending the extra steps in root cause analysis of a
problem. It's hard to argue when you wouldn't want to at least figure
out what the root cause of a problem is, even if you decide to just
treat a symptom.

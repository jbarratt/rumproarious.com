If you are interested at all in what is happing to curation you should
read this [well-researched
article](http://www.archimuse.com/mw2010/papers/cope/cope.html) by
[Aaron Cope](http://www.aaronstraupcope.com/). The article stems from
Cope's time at [Stamen Design Group](http://content.stamen.com/), and
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), but it doesn't stop there. This is a
deep article with a lot of links, and references.

When I look at the future I see curation tools, and I love finding other
smart people who seems to be exploring curation.

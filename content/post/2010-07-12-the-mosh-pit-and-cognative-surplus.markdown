I was caught off guard by an interesting compare/contrast over at
[snarkmarket](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5832). Two quotes from recent
books, both disparaging looks at pre-internet life. The author, Tim
Carmody, asks if these kinds of feelings are what are driving us to use
our cognitive surplus towards creation.

Maybe slightly, orthogonal to his original idea, was a thought that
pop'ed into my head. Not just why are people leaving TV, but how. I have
tried to get my parents to use "newer" things, like linux, bad idea I
know, but here they are using the internet in interesting ways, in
creative ways all without "my help". Where did they learn to do that.

When I think about this I am reminded of my first concert going
experience. I was 14, or 15, and I came upon a mosh pit, literally kids
banging up against one another. My first thought being, why the hell
not, and I joined in. At some point I fell. Now, I had never met any one
in this pile, but 4 people reached to pick me up, and a couple others
communicated to watch out. Quickly, I was set right, and re-joined the
mosh.

What I have always found remark able, was how quickly a community
coalesced around an organizing principal. There was no rule book, but
the rules were clearly being communicated, in a viral method. Maybe that
is why it’s easy to leave the TV. The rules of using our cognitive
surplus aren’t explicit, but implicit, and easy to under stand, and
spreading in a viral method.

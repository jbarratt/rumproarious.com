[![image](http://alexkessinger.net/assets/fguf-300x158.png "fguf")](http://alexkessinger.net/assets/fguf.png)I
have followed the discussion around curation on twitter for a couple of
weeks, and the volume has been manageable, but in the last two days the
volume of traffic on twitter about curation has been huge. I checked out
[topsy](http://hea.pe/l7), and it confirmed my suspicion that curation
has seen a huge surge in traffic in the last two days. Probably due to
these couple of stories all coming out at the same time. The volume may
not stay here forever but curation tools are coming out at a scary pace.
I hopefully have some more research to publish here about curation soon.

I haven't touched my IM client in a month, and I am loving it. At work
we use IRC to keep a running discussion. I was skeptical at first. I
wouldn't be able to get growl notification, and I was going to use
irssi, an in terminal IRC client.

On all counts IRC is better. Growl notifications just aren't needed. As
I program there are natural pausing moments. I just pull up the
terminal, and see if there is everything new.

[irssi](http://irssi.org/) is like a an ikea
[URBAN](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80067789) chair, if
you haven't had the pleasure of these chairs go to an ikea near you. The
chair is a champ. It's injection molded plastic which makes it both easy
to clean, and durable. There are no screws to get loose, and there is no
paint to scratch off. They just sit around my dinning room table, and
work, they do there job. irssi, in combination with
[screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) just work. I ssh'ed into a
server the day I started, created a screen running irssi, and it has run
since then. I can disconnect, and reconnect whenever. This allows me the
capture the entire conversation even when I am not there. This is
something that desktop client like colloquy can't do.

Here is the problem investigative journalism is having trouble finding
investment. When you look at investigative journalism it can be hard
from an economic perspective to defend, but it's very necessary to
running a useful fourth estate. So, how do you fund investigation
journalists with out also running a charity. What I find interesting
about this question is that I work in an industry that has dealt with
this exact issue. I build websites for a living, and I work for a
startup. Basically my bosses had an idea, a good one I think, and they
wanted to build it. Because they live in Silicon Valley, and because we
have apparatuses here like Angel investors, and VC firms they were able
to get an investment on nothing more than the speculation that they
would build a successful company. I am not an investigative journalist,
but I imagine their situation to be similar. Except in one key area,
they don't have a Silicon Valley. There are probably some technological
tools that could help push a market like this along, but mostly it's a
human solution. Maybe the news co's should outsource finding good
investigative journalism to a system like Silicon Valley.
